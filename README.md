On launch, the VST generates 10 different delay lines with different delay times and pan positions. Depending on __*Switch Speed*__, the vst randomly switches between the different delay lines. Setting the __*Random Pan Position*__ or __*Random Delay Time*__ parameter to "On" will generate a new position or delay time. __NOTE:__ you must reselect "On" every time you want a new delay time or pan position. You can do this by automated the parameter to "Off" before you would like to activate "On".

__*High Delay Time*__ and __*Low Delay Time*__ controls the maximun and minimum delay times for the randomization. Changing these parameters will also randomize the delay time for each line. __*Ramp Time*__ controls the speed in which the relevant parameters take to get to their new values.

__*Wet/Dry Mix*__ controls the balance between the delay and the dry uneffected sound.  __*Delay Feedback*__ is percentage amount of sound fedback into the delay line. Each indiviual has its own delay that is controlled via this parameter.
